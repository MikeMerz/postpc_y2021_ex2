# AndroidCalculator - Calculator exercise for Android developers

I pledge the highest level of ethical principles in support of academic excellence.  I ensure that all of my work reflects my own abilities and not those of someone else.

Answer to Question:
If we were to add a multi button then we would have to change SimpleCalculatorImp becuase we would need the logic to support this action and besides we will have to change the XML 
in order to add the button itself(so it will be visible), change MainActivity so it will make the button a clicklistener and call the right method, and for the testing we would need to add logic test to the SimpleCalculatorImpTest in order to test our multi method and add tests to the MainActivity and Flow tests in order to check if the button acts correctly and calls the correct function.

## In this project:
- Calculator screen with XML ready for portrait and landscape
- Calculator interface used by the Activity
- Unit tests for the calculator and the activity

## Your job:
- Implement `SimpleCalculatorImpl.java`
- add more unit tests to `SimpleCalculatorImpl.java`
- Implement `MainActivity.java`
- add more unit tests to `MainActivityTest.java`
- add more flow tests to `AppFlowTest.java`

Basically look for "TODO" in the code.


Good luck!
